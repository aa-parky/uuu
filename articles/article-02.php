<h5 class="card-title">New Office 'Burrows' into Redridge"</h5>

<p class="card-text typewritter">In an undisclosed nook of Redridge, where the shadows whisper secrets and the earth itself
    holds its breath, a new field office of the Undermine Undertakers is said to be opening
    soon. Led by the notoriously discreet Lastrights Rumblecoin, <img src="/images/x-marks-02.png" class="photos-article-no-border" style="float:left;" alt="x marks the spot">this band of
    faction-independent Goblins operates beyond the fringe, providing 'final services' for the
    bravest souls who've met their untimely end in Hardcore mode.</p>

<p class="card-text typewritter">Rumors swirl like the mists of the Loch, suggesting that this new office will offer a range
    of <span class="article-comic-red">'afterlife accommodations'</span> from securing a hero's hard-earned loot to ensuring their
    tales of valor are sung in the taverns across Azeroth.</p>

<p class="card-text typewritter">Yet, the exact location of this office remains as elusive as a rogue in stealth. Wink-wink,
    nudge-nudge, say no more – those in <img src="/images/arrow_up_right_02.png" class="photos-article-no-border" style="float: right;" alt="arrow">the know understand that finding the Undermine
    Undertakers is part of the journey. It's said that a clever clue-seeker should follow the
    trails not on any map, where only the bravest dare to tread.</p>
<p class="card-text typewritter">Lastrights Rumblecoin, the enigmatic leader of this goblin group, is renowned for his
    discretion and efficiency. "We take care of those who've taken their last breath,"
    Rumblecoin was heard saying at a clandestine congregation. <span class="article-comic-red">"And business is boomin' –
        because in Hardcore mode, everyone needs a friend on the other side."</span></p>

<p class="card-text typewritter">While some may see the Undermine Undertakers' services as morbid, there's a certain comfort
    in knowing that, even in death, the heroes of Hardcore mode are never forgotten, and their
    legacies are in capable, if slightly greasy, hands.</p>

<p class="card-text typewritter">So keep your eyes peeled and your ears to the ground. The opening of the Undermine
    Undertakers' Redridge office is imminent, and for those who find it, the rewards – and
    stories – could be life-changing. Or should we say... afterlife-changing?</p>
