<h5 class="card-title">final service extravaganza</h5>
<p class="card-text typewritter">
    In the bustling bazaar of Ratchet, where the clinks of gold are as common as the clatter of
    gears, a peculiar scene unfolded that even the most brazen buccaneer couldn't help but gawk
    at. <span class="article-comic-red"> Undermine Undertakers</span>, Azeroth's premier post-mortem property purveyors, found
    themselves swamped with applicants - a motley crew of goblins of all shapes and grins, each
    clamoring to join the ranks of the most spirited (and profitable) enterprise this side of
    the Great Sea.
</p>
<p class="card-text typewritter">
    Led by Lastrights Rumblecoin, a goblin so shrewd he'd charge you for the dirt your boots
    carried into his office, the Undertakers had put out the call for additional hands. Or
    claws. Or whatever appendages one might bring to the table. <span class="article-comic-red">"Graveyard shifts ain't never
        been this lively!"</span> cackled Lastrights, his own pockets jingling with the sound of success.
</p>
<p class="card-text typewritter">
    But why the sudden surge of wannabe undertakers? Well, it seems that the heroes of the
    hardcore realms had been <img src="/images/dragon-marker-01.png" class="photos-article-no-border" style="float: left;" alt="arrow"> biting the dust with such frequency that the Undertakers' ledger
    looked more like a tome than a tally sheet.</p>
<p class="card-text typewritter">
    <span class="article-comic-red"> "Heroes falling left and right, and every one of
        them needs a proper send-off!"</span> Lastrights had declared. After all, even the bravest human,
    trembling before their untimely demise, deserved a final farewell worthy of song—or at least
    a footnote in <a href="https://mrglglglgl.com">"mrglglglgl."</a>
</p>
<p class="card-text typewritter">
    The Ratchet office, usually reserved for hush-hush deals and the occasional coin-counting
    contest,
    had been <img src="/images/arrow_up_right_02.png" class="photos-article-no-border" style="float: right;" alt="arrow">transformed into a raucous recruitment rally. Hopefuls arrived with shovels slung
    over shoulders
    embalming fluid samples, and some even sporting prototype
    pocket-sized tombstones for the adventurer on the go.
    "It's all about efficiency," winked a wide-eyed applicant, unveiling a tombstone that
    doubled as a dinner plate.
</p>
<p class="card-text typewritter"> Lastrights surveyed the chaos with glee. Each new recruit
    meant more hands to dig, more
    pockets to fill, and, most importantly, more eyes to witness his entrepreneurial empire. The
    deaths, the destruction, the quivering humans meeting their end - it was all part of the
    cycle of loot and life in Azeroth.
</p>
<p class="card-text typewritter">And at the center of it all, the Undermine Undertakers
    reaped the rewards, their laughter echoing through the streets, mingling with the clinks of
    their ill-gotten gains and the inevitable cries of those heroes yet to fall.

    <span class="article-comic-red">"Apply within!"</span> the sign read, bobbing above the crowd. "Where there's doom, there's gold!"
    And in the world of the Undertakers, business was booming—or should we say, "dooming"?
